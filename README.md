# Retail Sales Analysis 📊

Welcome to my Retail Sales Analysis project! 🎉  
This repository contains a dataset I've practiced on, using various data analysis techniques such as sums, averages, VLOOKUP, IF statements, and pivot charts to gain insights into retail sales performance. 

## 🔎 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes retail sales data with multiple columns such as product ID, product name, sales figures, date, store location, and more.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
In this project, I applied the following Excel functions and tools to analyze the data:

- **SUM** ➕: Calculated total sales across different categories.
- **AVERAGE** 📏: Determined the average sales per product.
- **VLOOKUP** 🔍: Used for retrieving data from different columns based on a lookup value.
- **IF** 🧮: Applied conditional logic to classify data (e.g., high/low sales).
- **Pivot Charts** 📊: Created pivot charts to visually analyze trends and comparisons.
